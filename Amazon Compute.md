EC2 Purchasing Options — Notes 

On-Demand Instances 

Best for short workloads 

Predictable pricing, billed per second 

No long-term commitment 

Reserved Instances (1 & 3 years) 

Ideal for long workloads 

Reserved Instances → fixed instance families 

Convertible RIs → long workloads with flexible instance types 

Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) 

Commit to a certain amount of usage 

Best for long workloads with some flexibility 

Spot Instances 

Very cheap, great for short workloads 

Can be interrupted → less reliable 

Dedicated Hosts 

Book an entire physical server 

Gives control over instance placement (useful for licensing, compliance) 

Dedicated Instances 

Hardware is not shared with other AWS customers 

Capacity Reservations 

Reserve instance capacity in a specific Availability Zone 

Any duration, no long-term commitment required
